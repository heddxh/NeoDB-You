# Android/Kotlin

## Do I need `org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-android`?
No. Although the [Android developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines#dependency) suggests adding this dependency, it is already included as a transitive dependency in the library.  
See: [Stack Overflow Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/74861174/22591462)

## Why is the top-level `build.gradle.kts` empty?
Since this is a single-module project, all plugins and dependencies are declared in the `:app` module.

## About `Modifier`
In my composable functions, `Modifier` should be the last parameter and passed to the first child that emits UI (e.g., `Row`, `Text`, etc.).

### Why isn't the latter `Modifier.fillMaxSize` working?
In layouts like `Row`, where child composables are measured from left to right, if an earlier composable already uses `Modifier.fillMaxSize`, subsequent composables won't receive any remaining space.
